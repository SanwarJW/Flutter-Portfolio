  Hi, Iâ€™m Sanwar Jayswal. Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer with a strong background in mobile development and back-end API.
  My journey started with learning Java and Spring Boot in college, where I built skills in creating REST APIs for back-end systems. Following college, I interned at Nakoa Technology, where I contributed to a Flutter project focused on carbon emissions, honing my expertise in Flutter.
  After my internship, I developed Gemini API ChatBot, a virtual assistant app built with Flutter. Recently, Iâ€™ve been learning IOS SwiftUI and created the Appetizers App, where I integrated APIs to enhance the user experience.

  Iâ€™m enthusiastic about tackling diverse projects and am open to opportunities in various areas of software development. If youâ€™re interested in discussing potential collaborations or just want to connect, feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜Š

I didnâ€™t focus much on school studies back then because I didnâ€™t realize how amazing computer programs were. If I had known, I would have definitely studied harder, especially in computer science.

A small story: After completing my B.Sc., I joined a BPO call center. I worked there for 10 days, and during that time, I saw developers coding. Despite studying computer science for three years, it wasnâ€™t until those 10 days on the job that I truly became interested. Inspired by what I saw, I quit the call center job, began teaching myself coding, and later enrolled in an M.Sc. program. Thatâ€™s when I really started to study seriously.""";
